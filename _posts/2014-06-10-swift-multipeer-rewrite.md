The amount of code that ran the Multipeer Protype was small, so I decided to just rewrite the damn thing in Swift to get a feel for the new language.

I decided for the hell of it to write something up journal style. Very stream of though-y, not sure how easy it is to read or not.

I really like Swift, it's amazing just how much extranious code just falls away when you start getting the hang out it. It really reminds me much more of writing in Javascript or Ruby. 

I've got to hand it to Apple, they didn't make any of my Cocoa knowledge obsolete at all. It's writing the same calls against the same frameworks tha that's amazing.
