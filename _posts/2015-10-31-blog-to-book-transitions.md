I've been working on something a little different over the last month. Things are now far enough along that I can mention it here. 

Instead of writing for my dev blog recently, I've been spending all of my writing energy writing an actual book. I'm working with Packt Publishing out of The UK to update their Xcode 6 Essentials book to Xcode 7.

Moving from a hobby dev blog to an actual book has been an interesting switch. I can also say that I've never focused and written so much in such a short amount of time. Really though, one chapter clocks in at over 10,000 words. I never thought I'd have that kind of capacity.

I'll be announcing here once it's published and in a purchasable state. I also have a few excerpts that I'm particularly proud of that I'll be posting here as well. 

Stay Tuned.
