I decided to put the source code for my first [app onto GitHub](https://github.com/brettohland/dbldbl).

Back in the heady days of 2012 and 2013, I decided that after 8 years of doing front-end development that I wanted to become an iOS developer.

[dbldbl](http://dbldblapp.com) ([Double Double](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Double-Double)) was the first app that I ever released onto The App Store. It was a pretty simple little app that used the Core Image frameworks to simply set some filters on two images.

Considering that I came from an ActionScript 3 and Javascript background, getting dumped head-first into a C based language with memory retain and release cycles was one heck of a metaphorical hill to climb.

I ended up having to teach myself Objective-C, C (for Core Image manipulation), Cocoa, Blocks, GCD, Storyboards, Mobile Design, Code Signing and the list goes on and on and on.

There's a lot of rough edges on the app, it's pretty clear that this is someone's first public release.

The application did pay off though, I managed to make enough money off of it that it paid for a few years of iOS development access and it gave me enough confidence with iOS/Cocoa to ultimately get a job doing iOS development full time.

Plus I created some really great images:
