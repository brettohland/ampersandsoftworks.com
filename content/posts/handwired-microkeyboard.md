Back in the depths of 2017, I had the strong desire to build my own keyboard fully from scratch.

I had built the Ergodox from a kit two years earlier. And while I had fun assembling it and working out how to flash the microcontroller, I wanted to really get in there and build myself a keyboard from scratch to truly understand how it all works.

I'm writing this with 3 year hindsight, so I won't be going into any details about the build process.

General Outline:
- Designed the keyboard plate and has Lasergist cut it
- Designed the case, had Ponoko cut it
- Gateron Brown switches (leftover from the Ergodox)
- Runs the QMK firmware
- Piezo speaker for bleeps and bloops

But this is what I ended up with:
