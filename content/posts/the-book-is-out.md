It's official, the book that I've been writing is in print and available for purchase.

I'll be publishing excerpts from the book soon.

[Xcode 7 Essentials - Second Edition from Pack Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/xcode-7-essentials-second-edition)

> Apple’s Xcode technology is making the development curve smoother than it has ever been with its easy-to-develop features and enhancements. With the latest release of Xcode 7, Apple has also added great support for Swift development.

>This book will introduce you to all the new features of Xcode 7 and demonstrate how Swift programming can be much easier, faster, and simply better with Xcode!

>Even if you’re starting with just a little knowledge of Swift or Xcode, you will learn the basics of the language as well as the tool. You will then use this knowledge to create simple applications and will learn how to debug and optimize your code. At the end of this book, you would have learned enough to build, run and submit your very own application to the App Store.
